# Personal CRUD API Project

## Description
This is my personal project for learning **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.  
Itâ€™s a simple **CRUD API** built while following the OpenClassrooms course:  
[Go Full Stack with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6390246-passez-au-full-stack-avec-node-js-express-et-mongodb).

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Setting up a Node.js + Express backend  
- Connecting to a MongoDB database  
- Implementing RESTful CRUD operations
- Implementing token authentication
